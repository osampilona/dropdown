## Nested Menu with SubmenuTrigger

This application demonstrates how to implement a nested menu component utilizing the `SubmenuTrigger` from `react-aria`. The `Submenu` component, currently in its alpha phase, functions as an integral part of the `Menu`.

### Features

- **Fully Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive across all devices, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Theming with Provider:** By wrapping the app with a `Provider` component, we can effortlessly apply themes throughout the application. This guarantees that the theme is consistently applied to all components.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** The application adheres to the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Authoring Practices Guide (APG) standards for menu bars, as specified by the W3C. See the standards [here](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/menubar/#keyboard-interaction-12). Implementation has been tested for accessibility, with no failures encountered.

### Implementation

The implementation of the nested menu was straightforward, efficient, and clean. Following the import of `SubmenuTrigger`, adjustments were made to `index.tsx`, allowing for the removal of the code provided in the task without compromising functionality.

### Outcome

The application functions as intended, meeting all specified requirements and offering a robust solution for incorporating nested menus within applications. This approach ensures that the application is accessible, themeable, and responsive, aligning with current web standards and best practices.
